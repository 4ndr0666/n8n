## [Showcase] Social Profile Monitor v2.0 â€“ OSINT Automation Agent (Multi-Platform)

Hey n8n crew ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m sharing v2.0 of my **Social Profile Monitor**, inspired by the automation goals described by Quilligenceâ€™s human-driven OSINT team (as shared in James McQuigganâ€™s talk).

ðŸŽ¯ What it does:
- Scrapes and analyzes social activity across **LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook**, and more
- Uses **GPT-4o** to summarize updates and generate actionable insights
- Logs changes via Google Sheets, alerts via email

ðŸ§  Real-world use cases:
- Sales teams monitoring leads
- Brand managers watching reputation
- Security researchers tracking surface changes

ðŸ“¦ Download the workflow and docs:
- JSON: [`social-profile-monitor.json`](link)
- Dataset: [`n8n-dataset`](https://github.com/4ndr0666/n8n/tree/main/datasets/n8n-dataset)
- Deep Research: [`n8n.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4ndr0666/n8n/main/deep_research/n8n.md)

ðŸ’¬ Would love your feedback or suggestions. Next up: Mastodon + Pinterest modules!
